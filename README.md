The goal of this project is to implement the XBox Live TrueSkill algorithm to the MinuteMan Dart League.

I played a season in Spring 2015, and as the season went on, I found myself fascinated by what my skill would be against my opponents, and how teamed matches would affect it. In my professional career, I find that I'm more of a functional programmer than I'd like to be, and in this exercise, I'd like to stick to Object-Oriented a bit more.
